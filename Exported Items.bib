  abstract = {Individual behaviour and local context can influence the evolution of ecological interactions and how they structure into networks. In trophic interactions, consumers can increase their fitness by actively choosing resources that they are more likely to explore successfully. Mathematical modelling is often employed in theoretical studies to understand the coevolutionary dynamics between consumers and resources. However, they often disregard the individual consumer behaviour since the complexity of these systems usually requires simplifying assumptions about interaction details. Using an individual-based model, we model a community of several species that interact antagonistically. Each individual has a trait (attack or defence) that is explicitly modelled and the probability of the interaction to occur successfully increases with increased trait-matching. In addition, consumers can actively choose resources that guarantee greater fitness. We show that active consumer choice can generate coevolutionary units over time. It means that the traits of both consumers and resources converge into multiple groups with similar traits and the species interactions stay restricted to these groups over time. We also observed that network structure is more dependent on the parameter that delimits active consumer choice than on the intensity of selective pressure. Thus, our results support the idea that consumer active choice behaviour plays an important role in the ecological and evolutionary processes that structure interacting communities.},

  abstract = {Many theoretical models have been formulated to better understand the coevolutionary patterns that emerge from antagonistic interactions. These models usually assume that the attacks by the exploiters are random, so the effect of victim selection by exploiters on coevolutionary patterns remains unexplored. Here we analytically studied the payoff for predators and prey under coevolution assuming that every individual predator can attack only a small number of prey any given time, considering two scenarios: (i) predation occurs at random; (ii) predators select prey according to phenotype matching. We also develop an individual based model to verify the robustness of our analytical prediction. We show that both scenarios result in well known similar coevolutionary patterns if population sizes are sufficiently high: symmetrical coevolutionary branching and symmetrical coevolutionary cycling (Red Queen dynamics). However, for small population sizes, prey selection can cause unexpected coevolutionary patterns. One is the breaking of symmetry of the coevolutionary pattern, where the phenotypes evolve towards one of two evolutionarily stable patterns. As population size increases, the phenotypes oscillate between these two values in a novel form of Red Queen dynamics, the episodic reversal between the two stable patterns. Thus, prey selection causes prey phenotypes to evolve towards more extreme values, which reduces the fitness of both predators and prey, increasing the likelihood of extinction.},

  abstract = {In the tropics, antagonistic seed predation networks may have different properties than mutualistic pollination and seed dispersal networks, but the former have been considerably less studied. We tested whether the structure of antagonistic tripartite networks composed of host plants, insects developing within seeds and fruits, and their insect parasitoids could be predicted from plant phylogenetic distance and plant traits. We considered subsets of the networks (‘subnetworks') at three rainforest locations (Panama, Thailand, Papua New Guinea), based on insect families, plant families or plant functional groups. We recorded 3197 interactions and observed a low percentage of realized interactions, especially in Panama, where insect host specificity was higher than in Thailand or New Guinea. Several factors may explain this, including insect faunal composition, incidence of dry fruits, high fruit production and high occurrence of Fabaceae at the Panamanian site. Host specificity was greater among seed-eaters than pulp-eaters and for insects feeding on dry fruits as opposed to insects feeding on fleshy fruits. Plant species richness within plant families did not influence insect host specificity, but site characteristics may be important in this regard. Most subnetworks were extremely specialized, such as those including Tortricidae and Bruchinae in Panama. Plant phylogenetic distance, plant basal area and plant traits (fruit length, number of seeds per fruit) had important effects on several network statistics in regressions weighted by sampling effort. A path analysis revealed a weak direct influence of plant phylogenetic distance on parasitoid richness, indicating limited support for the ‘nasty host hypothesis'. Our study emphasizes the duality between seed dispersal and seed predation networks in the tropics, as key plant species differ and host specificity tends to be low in the former and higher in the latter. This underlines the need to study both types of networks for sound practices of forest regeneration and conservation.},

  abstract = {Floral resources can be recognized by visitors through attractants that signal their presence. However, besides petals, it is still unclear how floral elements in heterantherous species are perceived by visiting bees. In this study, we aim to understand the role of stamens and petals of Pleroma granulosum and P. raddianum in attracting pollination bees, mainly by evaluating whether pollinator behaviour differs in response to different sized stamens between which there is no apparent colour contrast. Using colour visual models, we estimated bee colour discrimination between stamen sets and corolla in both species and carried out preference experiments among floral elements, using the bees Bombus morio and Xylocopa frontalis as models in the field. Pollination and feeding stamens are not discriminable by bees in both plant species. Bees only preferred flowers with petals, indicating that they are essential to long-distance attraction. During preferential tests, bees seemed to better respond to visual stimuli on the right side, suggesting lateralization. We also demonstrate that tactile stimulation by the anthers is necessary to trigger bee buzzing behaviour. Thus, since bees were not specifically attracted to any stamen set, heteranthery without colour differences between stamens is not enough to determine bee choice behaviour.},

  abstract = {Flowers that provide only pollen to pollinators should maximize pollen release for reproduction while minimizing pollen loss through consumption by bees. In flowers that are polymorphic for stamen type, the number of pollen grains produced as well as stamen morphology likely influences pollen release dynamics and favor the division of labor between stamens with different functions. However, few studies have evaluated such predictions. In this study, we tested the “division of labor hypothesis” considering not only the stamen morphology of pollen flowers but also their pollen release dynamics. Stamen morphology as well as the amount and viability of pollen were characterized in two Melastomataceae species, Pleroma granulosum and Pleroma raddianum. Using artificial vibrations, we estimated pollen release dynamics throughout anthesis in the anthers of short and long stamens from flowers of both species. P. granulosum flowers presented low heteranthery (i.e., anthers differed by only about 1~mm in length) and short stamens produced fewer pollen grains in both species. We also found similarly high viability of pollen from all anthers of both species. Although pollen grain release increased in all anthers over the flower´s lifespan, their dynamics were different between the two stamen sets in both species. Anthers of shorter stamens tended to release fewer and proportionally lower quantities of pollen grains at each time interval than anthers of longer stamens. Our study suggests that the number of pollen grains produced, as well as stamen morphology (beyond anther size) may control pollen release dynamics, leading to a division of labor between stamens in these pollen flowers.},

  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of ecological interactions are nowadays recognized as a crucial challenge to comprehend the assembly, functioning and maintenance of ecological communities, their processes and the services they provide. Nevertheless, while standards and databases for information on species occurrences, traits and phylogenies have been established, interaction networks have lagged behind on the development of these standards. Here, we discuss the challenges and our experiences in developing a global database of bipartite interaction networks. LifeWebs*1is an effort to compile community-level interaction networks from both published and unpublished sources. We focus on bipartite networks that comprise one specific type of interaction between two groups of species (e.g., plants and herbivores, hosts and parasites, mammals and their microbiota), which are usually presented in a co-occurrence matrix format. However, with LifeWebs, we attempt to go beyond simple matrices by integrating relevant metadata from the studies, especially sampling effort, explicit species information (traits and taxonomy/phylogeny), and environmental/geographic information on the communities. Specifically, we explore 1) the unique aspects of community-level interaction networks when compared to data on single inter-specific interactions, occurrence data, and other biodiversity data and how to integrate these different data types. 2) The trade-off between user friendliness in data input/output vs. machine-readable formats, especially important when data contributors need to provide large amounts of data usually compiled in a non-machine-readable format. 3) How to have a single framework that is general enough to include disparate interaction types while retaining all the meaningful information. We envision LifeWebs to be in a good position to test a general standard for interaction network data, with a large variety of already compiled networks that encompass different types of interactions. We provide a framework for integration with other types of data, and formalization of the data necessary to represent networks into established biodiversity standards.},

  abstract = {Resource specialisation, although a fundamental component of ecological theory, is employed in disparate ways. Most definitions derive from simple counts of resource species. We build on recent advances in ecophylogenetics and null model analysis to propose a concept of specialisation that comprises affinities among resources as well as their co-occurrence with consumers. In the distance-based specialisation index (DSI), specialisation is measured as relatedness (phylogenetic or otherwise) of resources, scaled by the null expectation of random use of locally available resources. Thus, specialists use significantly clustered sets of resources, whereas generalists use over-dispersed resources. Intermediate species are classed as indiscriminate consumers. The effectiveness of this approach was assessed with differentially restricted null models, applied to a data set of 168 herbivorous insect species and their hosts. Incorporation of plant relatedness and relative abundance greatly improved specialisation measures compared to taxon counts or simpler null models, which overestimate the fraction of specialists, a problem compounded by insufficient sampling effort. This framework disambiguates the concept of specialisation with an explicit measure applicable to any mode of affinity among resource classes, and is also linked to ecological and evolutionary processes. This will enable a more rigorous deployment of ecological specialisation in empirical and theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {Resource specialization is a key concept in ecology, but it is unexpectedly difficult to parameterize. Differences in resource availability, sampling effort and abundances preclude comparisons of incompletely sampled biotic interaction webs. Here, we extend the distance-based specialization index (DSI) that measures trophic specialization by taking resource phylogenetic relatedness and availability into account into a rescaled version, DSI*. It is a versatile metric of specialization that expands considerably the scope and applicability, hence the usefulness, of DSI. The new metric also accounts for differences in abundance and sampling effort of consumers, which enables robust comparisons among distinct guilds of consumers. It also provides an abundance threshold for the reliability of the metric for rare species, a very desirable property given the difficulty of assessing any aspect of rare species accurately. We apply DSI* to an extensive dataset on interactions between insect herbivores from four folivorous guilds and their host plants in Papua New Guinean rainforests. We demonstrate that DSI*, contrary to the original DSI, is largely independent of sample size and weakly and non-linearly related with several host specificity measures that do not adjust for plant phylogeny. Thus, DSI* provides further insights into host specificity patterns; moreover, it is robust to the number and phylogenetic diversity of plant species selected to be sampled for herbivores. DSI* can be used for a broad range of comparisons of distinct feeding guilds, geographical locations and ecological conditions. This is a key advance in elucidating the interaction structure and evolution of highly diversified systems.},

This approach showed that only 58\% of the students, compared to 91\% of their parents, were fluent in indigenous languages, while the trends in key drivers of language skills (language use at home, proportion of mixed-language families, urbanization, students’ traditional skills) predicted accelerating decline of fluency to an estimated 26\% in the next generation of students.

  abstract = {Tomoplagia (Diptera: Tephritidae) are endophagous herbivores on flowerheads of Asteraceae, with varying levels of host specialization. We isolated, characterized, and tested the heterologous amplification for sets of microsatellites of three species from this genus associated with native hosts in the Espinhaço mountain range, Brazil. We used two protocols to build microsatellite-enriched libraries and characterized 12 polymorphic loci for each fruit-fly species. The samples of T. grandis, a monophagous species, presented a lower number of alleles than the samples of the oligophagous species T. incompleta and T. bicolor. The average observed heterozygosity did not vary among species and the high values of Polymorphism Information Content suggest that the characterized microsatellite loci are quite informative. The primers developed for each Tomoplagia species failed to amplify the microsatellite loci for the other two species, which indicates a low conservation of the flanking nucleotide sequences in the three evaluated species. The sets of polymorphic microsatellites characterized for these species of Tomoplagia may be used in future ecological and evolutionary studies that aim to detect patterns of diversity on a fine scale.},

  abstract = {Plants produce multiple specialised metabolites to defend themselves against insect herbivores. Phytochemical diversity plays important roles in plant–insect interactions, but specific roles of its various dimensions are poorly known. Interspecific chemical β-diversity represents variation in presence of species-specific metabolites or quantitative variation in concentrations of metabolites common to several plant species. We hypothesised that qualitative and quantitative variation in plant chemistry can have differential effects on herbivores from various insect orders. We linked phytochemical variation in willow salicylates (Salicaceae-specific metabolites) and flavonoids (widespread metabolites) to a standardised distance-based specialisation index (DSI*) in three orders of leaf-chewing insects: sawfly larvae, beetles, and caterpillars. In beetles, average DSI* accounting for host chemical β-diversity did not differ from DSI* disregarding host chemistry. Levels of chemical specialisation did not differ among beetle species feeding only on Salicaceae and those using other plant families, suggesting that both can overcome willow chemistry by alternative physiological or behavioural adaptations. Contrastingly, sawflies and caterpillars responded to willow chemistry, with their DSI* corresponding mainly to quantitative differences in willow metabolites. The DSI* accounting for salicylates did not differ from the one accounting for flavonoids in either of the two orders. Our results suggest that β-diversity in plant chemistry has differential effects on insect herbivores depending on their order and chemical β-diversity measurement used. Our results emphasise the importance of quantitative variation in plant chemical composition, suggesting that it does not always have to be rare or species-specific metabolites that drive host-choice of leaf-chewing insects.},

  abstract = {Trees can emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when under attack by herbivores, and these signals can also be detected by natural enemies and neighbouring trees. There is still limited knowledge of intra- and inter-specific communication in diverse habitats. We studied the effects of induced VOC emissions by three Ficus species on predation on the focal Ficus trees in a lowland tropical rainforest in Papua New Guinea. Further we assessed predation across a phylogenetically diverse set of neighbouring tree species. Two of the focal tree species, Ficus pachyrrhachis and F. hispidioides, have strong alkaloid-based constitutive defences while the third one, F. wassa, is lower in constitutive chemical defences. We experimentally manipulated the jasmonic acid signalling pathway by spraying the focal individuals with either methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DIECA). These treatments induce increases or decreases in VOC emissions, respectively. We tested the possible effects of VOC emissions on each focal Ficus tree and two of its neighbours by measuring the predation rate of plasticine caterpillars. We found that predation increased after the MeJA application in only one focal tree species, F. wassa, while the DIECA application had no effect on any of the three focal species. Further, we did not detect an effect of our treatments on predation rates across neighbouring trees. Neither the phylogenetic distance of the neighbouring tree from the focal tree nor the physical distance from the focal tree had any effect on predation rates for any of the three focal Ficus species. These results suggest that even congeneric tree species vary in their response to the MeJA and DIECA treatment and subsequent response to VOC emissions by predators. Our results also suggest that MeJA effects did not spill over to neighbouring trees in highly diverse tropical rainforest vegetation.},

The simplest and most trivial explanation for such variation in host use is the among-site variation in plant species composition. Another aspect that can influence spatial variation in host use is the relative abundance of each host-plant species compared to all available hosts. Here, we used endophagous insects that develop in flower heads of Asteraceae species as a study system to investigate how plant abundance influences the pattern of host-plant use by herbivorous insects with distinct levels of host-range specialization. Only herbivores recorded on three or more host species were included in this study. In particular, we tested two related hypotheses: 1) plant abundance has a positive effect on the host-plant preference of herbivorous insects, and 2) the relative importance of plant abundance to host-plant preference is greater for herbivorous species that use a wider range of host-plant species. We analyzed 11 herbivore species in 20 remnants of Cerrado in Southeastern Brazil. For 8 out of 11 herbivore species, plant abundance had a positive influence on host use. In contrast to our expectation, both the most specialized and the most generalist herbivores showed a stronger positive effect of plant species abundance in host use. Thus, we found evidence that although the abundance of plant species is a major factor determining the preferential use of host plants, its relative importance is mediated by the host-range specialization of herbivores.},

The right wing and aculeus of 100 individuals of each species were mounted on microscope slides, and images were captured with a stereomicroscope and light microscope. For wing image analysis, we used the color descriptor Local Color Histogram; for aculei, we used the contour descriptor Edge Orientation Autocorrelogram. A Support Vector Machine classifier was used in the final stage of wing and aculeus classification. Very accurate species identifications were obtained based on wing and aculeus images, with average accuracies of 94 and 95\%, respectively. These results are comparable to previous identification results based on morphometric techniques and to the results achieved by experienced entomologists. Wing and aculeus images produced equally accurate classifications, greatly facilitating the identification of these species. The proposed technique is therefore a promising option for separating these three closely related species in the fraterculus group.},

  abstract = {Within biological communities, species interact in a wide variety of ways. Species interactions have always been noted and classified by naturalists in describing living organisms and their ways. Moreover, they are essential to characterize ecological communities as functioning entities. Biodiversity databases, as a rule, are comprised of species records in certain localities and times. Many, if not most, originated as databases of museum specimens and/or published records. As such, they provide data on species occurrences and distribution, with little functional information. Currently, online databases for species interaction data are being formed or proposed. Usually, these databases set out to compile data from actual field studies, and their design reflects the singularities of particular studies that seed their development. In two online databases: theWeb of Life (2021)and theInteraction Web DataBase (2020)(IWDB), the categories of interactions are quite heterogeneous (Table1). For instance, they may refer explicitly to certain taxonomic groups (e.g., anemone-fish), or do so implicitly (host-parasitoid; parasitoids are all holometabolous insects with arthropod hosts); conversely, they may encompass almost any taxon (food webs). In another example, the Global Biotic Interactions database (Poelen et al. 2014) (GloBI) offers a choice of relational attributes when entering data, ranging from undefined to quite restricted (Table2). Here we intend to contribute to the development of interaction databases, from two different points of view. First, what categories can be effectively applied to field observations of biotic interactions? Second, what theoretical and applied questions do we expect to address with interaction databases? These should be equally applicable to comparisons of studies of the same kind or mode of interaction, and to contrasts between interactions in multimodal studies.},

  abstract = {Heterostyly is a floral polymorphism that reduces conflicts between sexual functions (sexual interference), such as self-pollination in self-incompatible flowers and loss of pollen to incompatible stigmas. In many distylous pollination systems, there is a remarkable structural fit between the stigmas of each morph and the part of the pollinator body where compatible (disassortative) pollen is deposited. Nevertheless, inter-morph pollen transfer is often asymmetrical, with short-styled flowers (S-morph) receiving less compatible pollen than long-styled flowers (L-morph). One way to reduce the problem of sexual interference in short-styled flowers is to place stigmas outside of the flower centre, as seen in three-dimensionally (3D) heterostylous flowers. Heterostyly in Turnera has been extensively studied; however, 3D heterostyly has not been previously reported in this genus. The aims of this study were: 1) to elucidate the pollination system of T. subulata; and 2) to assess whether 3D heterostyly promotes disassortative pollination and reduces self-pollination in short-styled flowers in this taxon. The study population of Turnera subulata exhibited an isoplethic (1:1) ratio, with two well-defined morphs, and a high floral accuracy index for both morphs. Results from an experiment in which we manipulated the 3D orientation of the style showed that compatible crosses were favoured by the 3D flower morphology, consistent with a high floral accuracy. Our results also demonstrate the functional importance of 3D heterostyly in reducing intramorph pollination, as it increases the amount of cross pollen reaching the S-morph flowers. Our results provide the first observation of the presence of 3D heterostyly in this well-studied species and demonstrate the importance of this kind of morphological specialization in ensuring efficiency in an ecologically generalized pollination system.},

Mating systems of animal pollinated plants are supposed to evolve in response to the availability of local pollinators, with consequent changes in flower morphology. We tested the relationship among pollination , mating system, and flower morphology over a large spatial scale in Brazilian savannas using the tree Curatella americana (Dilleniaceae). We compared fruit set with and without pollinators in the field, and analyzed pollen tube growth from self- and cross-pollinated flowers in different populations. Populations with higher natural fruit set also had lower fruit set in bagged flowers, suggesting stronger barriers to self-fertilization. Furthermore, higher levels of autogamy in field experiments were associated with more pollen tubes reaching ovules in self-pollinated flowers. Morphometric studies of floral and leaf traits indicate closer-set reproductive organs, larger stigmas and smaller anthers in populations with more autogamy. We show that the spatial variation in mating system, flower morphology and pollination previously described for herbs also applies to long-lived, perennial tropical trees, thus reemphasizing that mating systems are a population-based attribute that vary according to the ecological scenario where the plants occur.Keywords:~Cerrado savanna; mating system; pollination biogeography; reproductive assurance; self-compatibility},

Nevertheless, few studies have attempted to disentangle the contribution of historical and current factors, such as climate change and pollinator identity and behavior, on plant reproduction. Here, we attempted to separate the relative importance of current and historical processes on geographical patterns of the mating system of the tree species Curatella americana (Dilleniaceae). Specifically, we asked the following: (a) How do Quaternary and current climate affect plant mating system? (b) How does current pollinator abundance and diversity relate to plant mating system? (c) How does mating system relate to fruit/seed quantity and quality in C. americana? We recorded pollinators (richness, frequency, and body size) and performed pollination tests in ten populations of C. americana spread over 3,000 km in the Brazilian savannah. The frequency of self-pollination in the absence of pollinators was strongly influenced by historical climatic instability and not by present-day pollinators. In contrast, seed set from hand-cross and natural pollination were affected by pollinators (especially large bees) and temperature, indicating the importance of current factors on out-cross pollination. Two populations at the Southern edge of the species’ distribution showed high level of hand-cross-pollination and high flower visitation by large bees, but also a high level of autogamy resulting from recent colonization. Our results indicate that historical instability in climate has favored autogamy, most likely as a reproductive insurance strategy facilitating colonization and population maintenance over time, while pollinators are currently modulating the level of cross-pollination.},

  abstract = {Secondary succession is well-understood, to the point of being predictable for plant communities, but the successional changes in plant-herbivore interactions remains poorly explored. This is particularly true for tropical forests despite the increasing importance of early successional stages in tropical landscapes. Deriving expectations from successional theory, we examine properties of plant-herbivore interaction networks while accounting for host phylogenetic structure along a succession chronosequence in montane rainforest in Papua New Guinea. We present one of the most comprehensive successional investigations of interaction networks, equating to {$>$} 40 person years of field sampling, and one of the few focused on montane tropical forests. We use a series of nine 0.2 ha forest plots across young secondary, mature secondary and primary montane forest, sampled almost completely for woody plants and larval leaf chewers (Lepidoptera) using forest felling. These networks comprised of 12 357 plant-herbivore interactions and were analysed using quantitative network metrics, a phylogenetically controlled host-use index and a qualitative network beta diversity measure. Network structural changes were low and specialisation metrics surprisingly similar throughout succession, despite high network beta diversity. Herbivore abundance was greatest in the earliest stages, and hosts here had more species-rich herbivore assemblages, presumably reflecting higher palatability due to lower defensive investment. All herbivore communities were highly specialised, using a phylogenetically narrow set of hosts, while host phylogenetic diversity itself decreased throughout the chronosequence. Relatively high phylogenetic diversity, and thus high diversity of plant defenses, in early succession forest may result in herbivores feeding on fewer hosts than expected. Successional theory, derived primarily from temperate systems, is limited in predicting tropical host-herbivore interactions. All succession stages harbour diverse and unique interaction networks, which together with largely similar network structures and consistent host use patterns, suggests general rules of assembly may apply to these systems.},

  abstract = {Climate change is reaching several tipping points, likely resulting in habitat shifts at a global scale. Such changes could have serious consequences for migratory species. For instance, climatic changes may impact the distribution of breeding and non-breeding ranges, resulting in longer migration distances for some species. The flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are the largest family of birds in New World. They are small insectivorous birds with different distributions and migratory strategies, including both tropical and temperate species. Here, we aim to map the climatically suitable ranges for Tyrannidae in the future, compare them to their present ranges, and quantify the changes in range size and in migratory distance. We show different impacts on species that breed in the northern vs. southern hemisphere. Furthermore, results suggest that tropical and temperate species would suffer from different stressors. Neotropical austral migrant species would lose part of their breeding ranges, while Nearctic-Neotropical species would need to fly longer distances to reach the same climatic conditions of their current breeding ranges. Because past climate shifts have shaped the evolution of bird migration, these insights are also key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the evolution and regulation of bird migration, and for conservation planning.},

Their ability to detect HIPVs was shown to be learned, and not innate, yet the flexibility and generalization of learning remain unclear. We studied if, and if so how, naïve and trained great tits (Parus major) discriminate between herbivore-induced and noninduced saplings of Scotch elm (Ulmus glabra) and cattley guava (Psidium cattleyanum). We chemically analyzed the used plants and showed that their HIPVs differed significantly and overlapped only in a few compounds. Birds trained to discriminate between herbivore-induced and noninduced saplings preferred the herbivore-induced saplings of the plant species they were trained to. Naïve birds did not show any preferences. Our results indicate that the attraction of great tits to herbivore-induced plants is not innate, rather it is a skill that can be acquired through learning, one tree species at a time. We demonstrate that the ability to learn to associate HIPVs with food reward is flexible, expressed to both tested plant species, even if the plant species has not coevolved with the bird species (i.e., guava). Our results imply that the birds are not capable of generalizing HIPVs among tree species but suggest that they either learn to detect individual compounds or associate whole bouquets with food rewards.},

  abstract = {Assemblages of insect herbivores are structured by plant traits such as nutrient content, secondary metabolites, physical traits, and phenology. Many of these traits are phylogenetically conserved, implying a decrease in trait similarity with increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plant taxa. Thus, a metric of phylogenetic distances and relationships can be considered a proxy for phylogenetically conserved plant traits and used to predict variation in herbivorous insect assemblages among co-occurring plant species. Using a Holarctic dataset of exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars, we aimed at showing how phylogenetic relationships among host plants explain compositional changes and characteristics of herbivore assemblages. Our plant–caterpillar network data derived from plot-based samplings at three different continents included {$>$}28,000 individual caterpillar–plant interactions. We tested whether increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plants leads to a decrease in caterpillar assemblage overlap. We further investigated to what degree phylogenetic isolation of a host tree species within the local community explains abundance, density, richness, and mean specialization of its associated caterpillar assemblage. The overlap of caterpillar assemblages decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance among the host tree species. Phylogenetic isolation of a host plant within the local plant community was correlated with lower richness and mean specialization of the associated caterpillar assemblages. Phylogenetic isolation had no effect on caterpillar abundance or density. The effects of plant phylogeny were consistent across exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars. Our study reveals that distance metrics obtained from host plant phylogeny are useful predictors to explain compositional turnover among hosts and host-specific variations in richness and mean specialization of associated insect herbivore assemblages in temperate broadleaf forests. As phylogenetic information of plant communities is becoming increasingly available, further large-scale studies are needed to investigate to what degree plant phylogeny structures herbivore assemblages in other biomes and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding spatiotemporal trends on insect-plant interaction networks is essential to unveil the ecological and evolutionary processes driving herbivore specialisation. However, community studies accounting for temporal dynamics in host-plant specialisation of herbivorous insects are surprisingly scarce. Here, we investigated how seasonality affects specialisation of a temperate forest herbivore community. A substantial body of literature suggests that young plant foliage tends to be more protected by defence mechanisms effective against generalist insect herbivores than mature leaves. We thus hypothesised that herbivore specialisation would be highest in the early season, when young leaves are available, and that the degree of dietary specialisation would decline with leaf maturation. To test this hypothesis, we sampled more than 4700 folivorous caterpillars associated with 16 tree species within a 0.2 ha deciduous forest stand in eastern North America. We further examined the dietary specialisation of exposed feeders versus shelter builders (e.g. leaf rollers, leaf tiers, webbers). Contrary to our prediction, we observed a significantly less specialised herbivore fauna in the early season than in the two subsequent summer seasons. We further found that the seasonal increase in specialisation was driven by a remarkable turnover in species composition rather than by shifts in guild structure or intraspecific changes in diet breadth of the herbivores. These findings run counter to the widespread belief that young leaves are less susceptible to generalist insect herbivores. Our study underscores the need to account for temporal dynamics when contrasting herbivore specialisation among sites with pronounced seasonality.},

  abstract = {Vertical niche partitioning might be one of the main driving forces explaining the high diversity of forest ecosystems. However, the forest’s vertical dimension has received limited investigation, especially in temperate forests. Thus, our knowledge about how communities are vertically structured remains limited for temperate forest ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the vertical structuring of an arboreal caterpillar community in a temperate deciduous forest of eastern North America. Within a 0.2-ha forest stand, all deciduous trees\,≥\,5~cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were felled and systematically searched for caterpillars. Sampled caterpillars were assigned to a specific stratum (i.e. understory, midstory, or canopy) depending on their vertical position and classified into feeding guild as either exposed feeders or shelter builders (i.e. leaf rollers, leaf tiers, webbers). In total, 3892 caterpillars representing 215 species of butterflies and moths were collected and identified. While stratum had no effect on caterpillar density, feeding guild composition changed significantly with shelter-building caterpillars becoming the dominant guild in the canopy. Species richness and diversity were found to be highest in the understory and midstory and declined strongly in the canopy. Family and species composition changed significantly among the strata; understory and canopy showed the lowest similarity. Food web analyses further revealed an increasing network specialization towards the canopy, caused by an increase in specialization of the caterpillar community. In summary, our study revealed a pronounced stratification of a temperate forest caterpillar community, unveiling a distinctly different assemblage of caterpillars dwelling in the canopy stratum.},

  abstract = {Forest canopies are complex and highly diverse environments. Their diversity is affected by pronounced gradients in abiotic and biotic conditions, including variation in leaf chemistry. We hypothesised that branch-localised defence induction and vertical stratification in mature oaks constitute sources of chemical variation that extend across trophic levels. To test this, we combined manipulation of plant defences, predation monitoring, food-choice trials with herbivores and sampling of herbivore assemblages. Both induction and vertical stratification affected branch chemistry, but the effect of induction was stronger. Induction increased predation in the canopy and reduced herbivory in bioassays. The effects of increased predation affected herbivore assemblages by decreasing their abundance, and indirectly, their richness. In turn, we show that there are multiple factors contributing to variation across canopies. Branch-localised induction, variation between tree individuals and predation may be the ones with particularly strong effects on diverse assemblages of insects in temperate forests.},
