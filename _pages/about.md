Hi! I'm Leo RÃ© Jorge, Postdoctoral researcher at the Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, in the Department of Ecology. I'm an ecologist with a background in community ecology, plant-animal interactions, and analysis of complex ecological data.

## Current research projects
I've been employing tools from ecological networks and ecophylogenetics to investigate the drivers of specialization in Plant-Herbivore and Plant-Pollinator interactions.
